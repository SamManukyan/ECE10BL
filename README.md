Foundations of Analog and Digital Circuits &amp; Systems Labs

Lab 0 - The goal of this lab is to get familiar with the LTspice software, which allows users to simulate analog electronic circuits. We will analyze the simple circuit by hand then use the simulator to check if our results match.

Lab 1 - This lab introduces the imbalance of the NMOS and PMOS in the CMOS inverter and how the ratio of PMOS to NMOS affects the transient voltage (VTH) and the noise margin parameters in the CMOS (VIL, VOH, VOL, VIH, NMH, NML). It also introduced us to virtually simulating and implementing NMOS, PMOS, and CMOS inverters in LTspice. We were also exposed to the relationship between Kp  and Kn, and the derivation of the transient voltage and how it changes with different configurations.

Lab 2 - This lab session provided us with the opportunity to become familiar with the I-V curves of both NMOS and PMOS, including the triode and saturation regions. We also studied the characteristics of MOSFETs connected in parallel and the impact on drain-to-source current. In addition, we explored the concepts of current mirrors and analyzed the effective current flow in each branch.

Lab 3 - In this lab, we learn about MOSFET transconductance and how common-source and common-drain circuits work. We also learn to develop formulas for a MOSFET's transconductance and the relationship of gain in circuits. We use LTspice simulations to confirm the accuracy of the derived expressions, and then we construct the corresponding circuits to measure and analyze the outcomes.

Lab 4 -In this lab, we get to know BJTs by constructing equations that describe gain, input resistance, output resistance, and operating range in terms of variable resistances and circuit layout. We also see how a BJT can be used as an amplifier as well as a buffer as well as in multi-stages, taking measurements and analyzing them for each circuit.

Lab 5 - During our time in the laboratory, we examined the fundamental principles of operational amplifiers. In the initial pre-lab, we calculated the output voltage expressions for four distinct amplifiers based on their respective input voltages. In the subsequent pre-lab, we utilized LTspice to simulate the behavior of both the inverting and non-inverting amplifiers and investigated how the value of resistor Rf affected the gain. We also simulated the summing and differential amplifiers, examining their ability to perform addition and subtraction with various inputs. During the actual lab, we constructed both inverting and non-inverting amplifiers, utilizing a 10kÎ© potentiometer as the Rf component. By manipulating the potentiometer, we analyzed the relationship between Rf and the resulting output voltage.

Lab 6 - This lab was meant to teach us how to use energy storage elements in op-amps. We began by deriving the relationship between Vout and Vin for the op-amp differentiator and the integrator. Then we simulated the circuits using LTspice and confirmed that our derivations matched with our LTspice graphs. In the lab we built the RC differentiator and found the amplitude of the Vout given different frequencies for Vin.
